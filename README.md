June 2021 update: This repo is now hosted at: https://github.com/mtx-org/mtx 
This should be considered upstream for all future packagers. This repository on my personal account will not be updated further. 


This is a clone of the original MTX project as found on https://sourceforge.net/projects/mtx/

The project appears to be abandoned, the home page is down, and the latest changes stem from
almost a decade ago (as of November 2019).

The mtx folder contains the actual build files, while mtxweb contains an archive of their webpage.

I'll be holding onto this repo for the time being. Any future bug reports or issues should be
logged here. I'll do my best to make the necessary changes, but I make no promises. 

If you'd like to help out, reach out.
